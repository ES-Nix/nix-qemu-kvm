i was thinking about getting into writing it in lure why because
17:17
there is take lure this is what uh
17:20
one one engine one core engine now it is
17:23
a taking the operator with lua built in
17:25
so you have a lure interpreter also with
17:27
the tech integrator so that would be
17:29
because we don't it's automatically we
17:32
have a language where we can write but
17:34
rewriting everything in lure is a huge
17:37
uh work i i don't want to do at the
17:40
moment
17:41
what i would like to see is a better
17:43
integration or interaction of take life
17:45
manager with distribution so this is
17:48
quite i mean i'm also packaging for for
17:50
debian so i know what this means but it
17:52
is
17:54
so we have this user mode but it's not
17:55
optimal it would be better to have a
17:58
better interaction with these
18:00
distributions
18:01
then what is also a huge problem is
18:05
sounds trivial but
18:06
actually this is downloading lots of
18:08
files we have um as i said we have three
18:11
to four container per package times four
18:14
thousand so it's twelve thousand files
18:16
that author get downloaded for for an
18:18
installation
18:20
and to get this working somehow
18:22
uniformly well you don't want to have
18:24
code bars for everything
18:27
across all platforms is a pain
18:29
so we use lv lwp
18:32
to get a stable connection and keep them
18:34
up but it falls back to curl and the w
18:37
get
18:38
and i just mentioned certificates
18:39
because it just popped up again i mean
18:41
the let's encrypt isg
18:44
root x one problem
18:46
uh is still beating around so um yeah
18:49
it's surprisingly difficult to get this
18:51
right
18:52
um then cetan as i mentioned before so i
18:55
wish
18:56
always and i hope but it will not change
18:59
anymore for streak the rules i mean like
19:01
cran has extremistic rules of the format
19:03
of what is uploaded
19:05
so that is something that would be
19:07
really helpful for getting um
19:09
distributing because they could directly
19:11
install from sita like cran the ground
19:13
manager in starts directly from
19:15
agreement this is this is something we
19:17
cannot do at the moment
19:19
and i mean something because it was
19:21
discussed here reuse of some universal
19:24
package manager would be nice but i
19:27
haven't seen any of the package managers
19:29
being being able to run on on
19:32
the
19:33
set of systems we are supporting even
19:36
the reduced set of systems we are
19:38
putting on to the dvd
19:40
okay some resources uh if you want to
19:43
check back so the main website is on the
19:46
tap.org live that's the main website
19:48
this or well user documentation
19:50
developers documentation all kind of
19:52
stuff
19:53
there is a web view so the main
19:55
repository is a subversion repository uh
19:59
actually we had uh
